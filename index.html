        <h3>Freelance Gig </h3>
        <p>Had to make a website for one of my clients who {`didn't`} have a set out design for their own establishment.I i scoured GitHub to get inspiration for the design layout ,found this neat single page website with React and wanted to challenge myself to  turn it into a multipage  website using NextJs</p></br>
        <p>The reason why I chose NextJs is because its very good in SEO optimization and also index makes the website faster like the Flash</p>
